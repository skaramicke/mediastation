## 1. Install Docker

Install Docker and docker-compose for your system of choice.

## 2. Run this command to automatically download the docker images and start the services

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## 3. IP number
Find the IP number of the machine running the services.

## 4. DNS or hosts file configuration.
For noobs, add this to your /etc/hosts file (or equivalent):
```
{IP number} sabnzbd.media couchpotato.media sonarr.media plex.media
```
_Pros might choose to install a DNS service or just us a public ðŸ˜± IP configured with a proper domain name. For that, the nginx configs in `./config/nginx/nginx/site-confs` need changing. Also, SSL is a good idea in that scenaro... I won't even go there._

## 5. Final service configuration

Visit these urls to do final setup of each service:
* `http://sabnzbd.media`
* `http://couchpotato.media`
* `http://sonarr.media`
* `http://plex.media`

## 6. ???
Now it's up to you.

## 7. Profit!
